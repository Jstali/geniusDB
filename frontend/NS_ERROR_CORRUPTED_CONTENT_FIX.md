# NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT Fix Summary

## Issue

Vite was showing NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT and blocking loading of App.jsx due to references to deleted components.

## Root Cause

The App.jsx file contained imports and routes for components that had been deleted from the project:

1. MinimalPivotExample.jsx
2. PivotTableDebugTest.jsx

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cleaned up App.jsx

- Removed imports for missing components:
  - `import MinimalPivotExample from "./components/MinimalPivotExample";`
  - `import PivotTableDebugTest from "./components/PivotTableDebugTest";`
- Removed routes for missing components:
  - `<Route path="/minimal-pivot" element={<MinimalPivotExample />} />`
  - `<Route path="/pivot-table-debug-test" element={<PivotTableDebugTest />} />`

### 2. Cleaned Build Cache

- Deleted `node_modules/.vite` directory
- Deleted `dist` directory (if it existed)

### 3. Verified Component Integrity

- Confirmed that all remaining imports in App.jsx point to existing files
- Verified that App.jsx itself is not empty or corrupted

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Confirmed App.jsx has valid React component (default export)
2. ✅ Verified all import paths point to existing files
3. ✅ Cleaned build cache and restarted development server
4. ✅ Confirmed server starts without errors on port 5196
5. ✅ Verified App.jsx loads properly without MIME type errors

## Current Working Routes

- `/` → Redirects to `/login`
- `/login` → Login page
- `/dashboard` → Main dashboard
- `/map-test` → Map test component
- `/large-pivot-test` → Large dataset pivot test
- `/datatable-pivot-test` → DataTable pivot test
- `/pivot-verification` → Pivot table verification
- `/complete-pivot-flow-test` → Complete pivot flow test

## Resolution

The NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT error has been resolved. The development server now starts properly and App.jsx loads without any MIME type errors.
