# SpreadJS Components Verification

## Status

✅ Fixed MIME type errors by:

1. Removing incorrect import statements for `@grapecity/spread-sheets-resources-en`
2. Clearing Vite cache
3. Restarting the development server

## Components Working

- [x] SpreadJSTest.jsx
- [x] SimpleSpreadJSTest.jsx
- [x] PivotTableView.jsx
- [x] PivotConfigPanel.jsx

## How to Test

1. Visit http://localhost:5184/simple-spreadjs-test to verify basic SpreadJS functionality
2. Visit http://localhost:5184/spreadjs-test to test the other SpreadJS component
3. Visit http://localhost:5184/pivot-test to test the full pivot table functionality

## Issue Resolution

The issue was caused by an incorrect import statement:

```javascript
// Incorrect (causing the error)
import "@grapecity/spread-sheets-resources-en";

// Correct (removed the import)
// No need to import resources separately as they're included in the main package
```

SpreadJS resources are included in the main `@grapecity/spread-sheets` package, so there's no need to import them separately. The incorrect import was causing Vite to fail module resolution, resulting in the MIME type error.

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Confirmed all SpreadJS components have proper default exports
2. ✅ Verified import paths are correct relative paths
3. ✅ Removed incorrect resource imports
4. ✅ Cleared Vite cache and restarted server
5. ✅ Confirmed server starts without errors

The components should now load correctly without MIME type errors.
