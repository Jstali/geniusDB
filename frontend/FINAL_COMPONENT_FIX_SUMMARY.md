# Final Component Cleanup and Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

1. **MIME Type Error**: "Loading module from http://localhost:5173/src/App.jsx was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type"
2. **Missing Component Reference**: "pivot-test-component" route was still being referenced
3. **Broken Imports**: Several deleted components still had references in App.jsx

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cleaned up App.jsx

- Removed all imports and routes for deleted components
- Fixed formatting issues in the Routes configuration
- Ensured only existing components are referenced

### 2. Refactored Sidebar.jsx

- Completely rewrote the component to remove references to deleted components
- Kept only navigation buttons for existing components

### 3. Updated Documentation

- Fixed SPREADJS_PIVOT_FIX_VERIFICATION.md to reference the correct route (/pivot-table-debug-test)
- Updated references from PivotTableTestComponent.jsx to PivotTableDebugTest.jsx

### 4. Cleaned Build Cache

- Removed dist folder and Vite cache
- Reinstalled dependencies to ensure clean state

## Current Working Components

1. **MapTest** - /map-test
2. **MinimalPivotExample** - /minimal-pivot
3. **LargeDatasetPivotTest** - /large-pivot-test
4. **DataTablePivotTest** - /datatable-pivot-test
5. **PivotTableVerification** - /pivot-verification
6. **CompletePivotFlowTest** - /complete-pivot-flow-test
7. **PivotTableDebugTest** - /pivot-table-debug-test

## Verification

The application now starts without any import errors or routing issues. The development server runs on port 5194, and all pages load correctly without any missing component errors.

All references to deleted components have been removed from the codebase, and the application should function correctly without any MIME type errors.
