## Fixes Applied

### App.jsx

- Removed imports for all missing components
- Removed routes for all missing components
- Kept only references to existing components:
  - MapTest
  - MinimalPivotExample
  - LargeDatasetPivotTest
  - DataTablePivotTest
  - PivotTableVerification
  - CompletePivotFlowTest
  - PivotTableDebugTest

### Sidebar.jsx

- Completely refactored to remove references to deleted components
- Kept only functional navigation buttons for:
  - Pivot Verification
  - Complete Pivot Flow Test
  - Pivot Table Debug Test

## Components Still Referenced But Exist

The following components are still referenced in the codebase and exist:

1. **MapTest.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx
2. **MinimalPivotExample.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx
3. **LargeDatasetPivotTest.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx
4. **DataTablePivotTest.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx
5. **PivotTableVerification.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx
6. **CompletePivotFlowTest.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx
7. **PivotTableDebugTest.jsx** - Referenced in App.jsx

## Verification

All routes in App.jsx now point to existing components. The Sidebar has been cleaned up to only include navigation for existing components.

No broken imports or routes should remain in the application.
