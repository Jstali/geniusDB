# View Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the View Management feature for the Table/Map/Chart views in the GeniusDB application. The feature allows users to create, save, and apply up to 5 preset views with specific column selections and chart configurations.

## Backend Implementation

### Database Schema

Created a `user_views` SQLite table with the following structure:

- `id` - Primary key (auto-increment)
- `user_id` - Foreign key to users table
- `slot` - Integer (1-5) representing the view slot
- `name` - Optional friendly name for the view
- `selected_columns` - TEXT field storing comma-separated column names
- `chart_config` - TEXT field storing chart configuration as comma-separated values
- `updated_at` - Timestamp of last update
- `created_at` - Timestamp of creation
- Unique constraint on (user_id, slot)

### API Endpoints

Implemented RESTful API endpoints:

1. `GET /api/user/views` - Retrieve all 5 views for the authenticated user
2. `GET /api/user/views/{slot}` - Retrieve a specific view by slot (1-5)
3. `POST /api/user/views/{slot}` - Create or update a view for the given slot
4. `DELETE /api/user/views/{slot}` - Remove a saved configuration for a slot

### Validation Rules

- Slot must be between 1 and 5
- Column count must match the slot requirements:
  - View 1: Exactly 10 columns
  - View 2: Exactly 15 columns
  - View 3: Exactly 20 columns
  - View 4: Exactly 25 columns
  - View 5: Exactly 30 columns
- Selected columns stored as comma-separated string
- Chart configuration stored as comma-separated values (chartType,xAxis,yAxis)

## Frontend Implementation

### Components

#### 1. ViewManagementModal

Main modal that displays all 5 view slots in a grid layout:

- Shows preview of saved views with column count and selected columns
- Displays chart indicator if a chart is saved
- Provides Edit and Apply buttons for each view slot

#### 2. PivotViewEditor

Dedicated editor component for configuring a single view:

- Column selection with enforced count limits
- Chart configuration panel with type selection and axis selectors
- Chart preview area
- Validation for exact column count requirements

#### 3. Sidebar Integration

Updated Sidebar component to:

- Show View Management button only on Home page
- Handle API communication for saving and loading views
- Pass view data to parent components for application

### Features

- Exact column count enforcement per view slot
- Visual feedback for column selection limits
- Chart configuration with multiple chart types (Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter)
- Preview of selected columns in view management grid
- Error handling and user feedback for validation failures

## Data Storage Format

### Columns

Stored as comma-separated string in the `selected_columns` field:

```
col1,col2,col3,col4,col5
```

### Chart Configuration

Stored as comma-separated string in the `chart_config` field:

```
bar,Category,Value
pie,Category,Value
line,Time,Measurement
```

## Integration Points

### Table View

When a view is applied:

- Table columns are filtered to show only selected columns
- Column order matches the saved selection order

### Map View

When a view is applied:

- Map markers show popups with only selected columns
- Marker visibility follows Option A (show all markers but filter popup content)

### Chart View

When a view is applied:

- Chart configuration is used to render the appropriate chart
- If no chart config exists, shows CTA to configure in View Management

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. User clicks "View Management" button on Home page
2. Modal displays all 5 view slots with previews
3. User clicks "Edit" on desired slot
4. PivotViewEditor opens with column selection and chart configuration
5. User selects exactly the required number of columns
6. User configures chart (optional)
7. User saves view
8. User can later "Apply" saved views to update the application

### Validation

- Real-time feedback on column selection count
- Enforcement of exact column count per slot
- Error messages for mismatched selections
- Visual indicators for saved views with charts

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication integration
- Implement server-side validation for column existence
- Add filtering capabilities to views
- Include view naming functionality
- Add import/export functionality for views
