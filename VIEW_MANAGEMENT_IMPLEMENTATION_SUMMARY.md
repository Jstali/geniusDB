# View Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the View Management flow for the GeniusDB application. The implementation includes frontend components, backend API endpoints, database schema, and integration with existing application features.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Implementation

- **New Component**: Created [ViewManagementModal.jsx](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/frontend/src/components/ViewManagementModal.jsx) - A modal component that allows users to:

  - Save views with selected columns, chart configurations, and filters
  - Load previously saved views
  - Reset/clear saved views
  - Manage up to 5 view slots with different column limits

- **Updated Components**:

  - [Sidebar.jsx](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx): Updated to use the new ViewManagementModal component
  - [Dashboard.jsx](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx): Simplified view management state and prop passing
  - [HomePage.jsx](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx): Updated to properly apply view configurations to table, map, and chart components

- **Utility Functions**: Created [viewUtils.js](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/frontend/src/lib/viewUtils.js) with helper functions for applying view configurations to different components

### 2. Backend Implementation

- **API Endpoints**: Updated REST endpoints in [app.py](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/backend/app.py) to properly handle POST requests with request bodies instead of query parameters
- **Database Operations**: Implemented SQLite database operations with proper schema for user views
- **Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for view data including column limits, chart configurations, and filters

### 3. Database Schema

- **Table**: `user_views` with columns:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `user_id`: User identifier (default: 1)
  - `slot`: View slot (1-5)
  - `name`: View name
  - `selected_columns`: CSV string of selected columns
  - `chart_config`: JSON string of chart configuration
  - `filters`: JSON string of filter configuration
  - `created_at`: Timestamp
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp

### 4. Removed Unused Components

- **Deleted**: Removed the old [ViewManager.jsx](file:///Users/stalin_j/geniusdb/frontend/src/components/ViewManager.jsx) component which was causing conflicts with axios imports

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

1. `GET /api/user/views` - Fetch all saved views for a user
2. `GET /api/user/views/{slot}` - Fetch a specific saved view by slot
3. `POST /api/user/views/{slot}` - Save a user view to a specific slot
4. `DELETE /api/user/views/{slot}` - Reset/clear a saved view from a slot

### Column Limits

- Slot 1: Up to 10 columns
- Slot 2: Up to 17 columns
- Slot 3: Up to 20 columns
- Slot 4: Up to 25 columns
- Slot 5: Up to 30 columns

### Validation Rules

- View names are required
- At least one column must be selected
- Chart configurations are validated based on selected columns
- Filters are validated to ensure they reference selected columns

## Error Resolution

- **Fixed Axios Import Issue**: Removed unused axios import from ViewManagementModal.jsx
- **Removed Conflicting Component**: Deleted the old ViewManager.jsx component that was causing import conflicts
- **Standardized API Calls**: Ensured all API calls use fetch instead of axios for consistency
- **Backend Process Management**: Cleaned up conflicting backend processes and ensured proper port allocation

## Integration Status

The View Management flow is now complete and integration-ready:

- All frontend components are properly connected
- Backend endpoints are fully functional
- Database operations work correctly
- Validation and error handling are implemented
- UX follows the specified requirements

## Testing

- Verified backend API endpoints are accessible and returning correct data
- Confirmed frontend can communicate with backend through fetch API
- Tested view save/load/reset functionality
- Validated column limits and validation rules
