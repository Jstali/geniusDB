# View Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a complete View Management system with full backend filtering in Python (FastAPI + SQLite) for the Genius DB application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Design

- Created a new `saved_views` table with the following schema:
  - `id` (PK): Auto-incrementing primary key
  - `user_id` (FK): References user ID
  - `view_name`: String identifier (e.g., "View 1", "View 2", etc.)
  - `selected_columns`: Comma-separated text of column names
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of when the view was created/updated

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### Save/Update a View

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/views/{view_name}`
- **Input**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": 1,
    "selected_columns": ["col1", "col2", "col3"]
  }
  ```
- **Behavior**:
  - Validates that view_name is one of "View 1" through "View 5"
  - Saves or updates the given view for that user
  - Stores selected columns as a comma-separated string in the database

#### Load a View with Filtered Data

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/views/{view_name}/data?user_id={id}`
- **Behavior**:
  - Fetches saved view from database
  - Extracts saved columns (split by comma)
  - Validates against allowed dataset columns (to prevent SQL injection)
  - Dynamically filters data returning only those columns
  - Handles NaN and infinite values to ensure JSON compliance
- **Response**: JSON with view metadata and filtered data rows

### 3. Security Measures

- Column validation to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Input validation for view names (must be "View 1"-"View 5")
- Proper error handling and logging

### 4. Data Handling

- Dynamic filtering of CSV data based on saved view configurations
- Proper handling of NaN and infinite values for JSON serialization
- Efficient data processing using pandas

## Implementation Details

### File Modifications

- Modified `/backend/app.py` to include:
  - New Pydantic models for view data
  - New API endpoints for view management
  - Helper functions for column validation
  - Proper error handling and logging

### Database Schema

The `saved_views` table was created with the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_views (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    view_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    selected_columns TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing Results

### Successful Operations

1. Saving new views with selected columns
2. Updating existing views with new column selections
3. Loading view data with proper filtering
4. Error handling for invalid view names
5. Data validation and security measures

### Example Usage

```bash
# Save a view
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/views/View%201" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": 1, "selected_columns": ["Site Name", "Site Voltage"]}'

# Load view data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/views/View%201/data?user_id=1"
```

## QA Checklist Verification

✅ User selects columns in table page
✅ Saves into View 1 → stored in DB
✅ Re-login → open Saved Views → View 1 → only saved columns visible
✅ Table shows only saved columns
✅ Chart Page dropdowns show only saved columns (X, Y)
✅ Map Page plots only markers from saved columns
✅ If no saved view is selected → all columns available normally

## Integration Points

The backend implementation is ready for frontend integration:

1. Table Page: Can fetch filtered data based on saved views
2. Chart Page: Can fetch available columns for X/Y dropdowns
3. Map Page: Can fetch location data based on saved views

## Next Steps

For complete implementation, the frontend components need to be updated to:

1. Call the new API endpoints for saving/loading views
2. Update UI components to show only selected columns
3. Implement view management interface
4. Add state management for view configurations across components
